# alu-scripting

This repository contains my solutions for the Regular Expressions project at ALU.  
All solutions are written in Ruby using the Oniguruma regex library.

## Structure
- regular_expressions/ â†’ contains all regex tasks.

## Usage
To run any script:
./<filename>.rb "<string>"

Example:
./0-simply_match_school.rb "Best School"
# -alu-scripting
